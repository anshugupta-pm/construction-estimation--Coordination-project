Mock project for renovation estimation and coordination
# 🏗️ Construction Estimation & Coordination – Mock Project

**By Anshu Gupta**  
I created this mock renovation project to show how I’d approach project coordination and cost estimating—even though I’m new to construction. It’s a small, simple project, but it helped me understand how tasks, timelines, and costs work together in real-world settings.

📌 *This was a great way for me to bridge my experience in digital project coordination with the construction world. I’m excited to keep learning and apply this hands-on.*
